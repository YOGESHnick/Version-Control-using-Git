Git Hooks:
Git Hooks are custom scripts that Git runs automatically at certain events like pre-commit, post-commit, etc.

Uses:
- Ensures code quality by running linters before committing. 
- Prevents commits if tests fail.
- Automates repetitive checks to reduce errors.


Why use of hooks is suggested? 
- Prevents bad commits (e.g., syntax errors, missing semicolons)
- Maintains consistency across team projects
- Reduces manual checks and enforces best practices automatically
